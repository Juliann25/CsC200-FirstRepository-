      Once upon there lived a lonely polar bear, whose name was Sunny. One day he was 
      really sad, so he sighed a big sigh, which he realized created grass on the ground 
      and winds in the sky. He looked up, astonished, and said to himself, "I wonder what 
      else I could could do." So, he went around exploring to see what else would happen. 
      He found a long log that had two branches on each side and breathed on it. The log 
      started to take a human-like shape as he did, the branches becoming arms and legs. 
      Next, he picked up a couple of rocks and breathed on them, turning them into bugs.
